          <h4>EU: Migration and Human Rights Challenges</h4>
          <p>During the 2015 European migrant crisis, border nations faced over 1.3 million arrivals, highlighting gaps in cooperation under the Dublin Regulation. The EU introduced a relocation quota system for nearly 160,000 asylum seekers, but only 30% was achieved, putting significant pressure on Italy, Greece, and Hungary.</p>

          <p>The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum (2022–2024) aims to secure external borders, establish fast and efficient procedures, create a system of solidarity among member states, and strengthen international partnerships. However, political and ideological divides remain, with countries like Poland and Hungary voting against key measures, and Czechia and Slovakia often abstaining.</p>

          <p>The Visegrád Group’s dissent reflects domestic political pressures and policy red lines. Despite these challenges, the EU Pact maintains the burden on border states while offering financial incentives to redistribute migrants or provide aid to partner countries. Critics note that this framework does not fully address gaps from the Dublin Regulation and leaves external border states under strain.</p>

          <p>Development aid plays a critical role. Programs like the Global Europe initiative and the European Emergency Trust Fund for Africa link aid to cooperation on migration control. While this helps fund infrastructure and resources in partner countries, it raises concerns about sovereignty and the potential misuse of aid for domestic agendas.</p>

          <p>Overall, the EU Pact seeks to fix past legislative failures and unify EU migration policy. Yet structural gaps, persistent political divides, and the use of development aid as leverage continue to shape migration outcomes and human rights implications across the continent.</p>
